## üîÑ Dynamic Source Switching with Tooltip Preview

Vidify supports passing an array of video sources (srcs) to enable dynamic source switching. This feature allows users to seamlessly switch between different video sources within the same player instance. Additionally, when hovering over the next or previous video button, Vidify displays a tooltip previewing the next or previous video. This enhancement provides users with a visual preview of upcoming content, enabling informed decisions when switching between videos.

```jsx
import { VideoPlayer } from "vidify";

const videoSources = [
  "https://example.com/video1.mp4",
  "https://example.com/video2.mp4",
  "https://example.com/video3.mp4",
];

const MyVideoPlayer = () => (
  <VideoPlayer
    src={videoSources}
    controls
    autoplay
    className="my-video-player"
  />
);

export default MyVideoPlayer;
```

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dj6kxvxqb/image/upload/v1715112646/Screen_Shot_2024-05-07_at_9.07.27_PM_eca32w.png)

## üé® Customizable Primary Color

Vidify provides a 'primaryColor' prop that allows users to specify a custom primary color for the video player interface. This feature enables users to match the video player's appearance to their application's branding or design scheme.

```jsx
import { VideoPlayer } from "vidify";

const MyVideoPlayer = () => (
  <VideoPlayer
    src="https://example.com/video.mp4"
    controls
    autoplay
    primaryColor="red"
    className="my-video-player"
  />
);

export default MyVideoPlayer;
```

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dj6kxvxqb/image/upload/v1715112647/Screen_Shot_2024-05-07_at_9.08.33_PM_xcf3ij.png)

## üõ†Ô∏è Control Bar and Progress Bar Customization

The `controller` prop in Vidify allows for fine-grained control over the visibility and customization of the control bar and progress bar. Users can choose from various options to tailor the video player interface according to their needs.

### Option 1: Hide Control Bar and Progress Bar

Setting `controller={false}` hides both the control bar and progress bar, providing a minimalist video player interface.

### Option 2: Custom Control Bar

Passing a function to the `controller` prop allows users to create their own custom control bar using React components. The function receives an `actions` object containing methods to control the video playback (e.g., `play`, `pause`).

```jsx
controller={(actions, info) => (
  <div>
    <span onClick={actions?.play}>Play</span>
    <span onClick={actions?.pause}>Pause</span>
  </div>
)}

```

### Option 3: Advanced Control Options

Users can provide an object to the `controller` prop to enable advanced control options. This object allows for granular control over individual components of the video player interface, such as the screenshot button, fullscreen button, and progress bar.

```jsx
controller={{
  screenshot: {
    allow: true,
    style: { color: "red" },
    className: "custom-button",
  },
  fullscreen: false,
  progressBar: false,
  controlBar: (actions, info) => (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", columnGap: "10px" }}>
      <p>{info.currentTime} / {info.duration}</p>
      <button onClick={actions?.play}>Play</button>
      <button onClick={actions?.pause}>Pause</button>
      <p>Volume</p>
      <input
        type="range"
        onChange={(e) => actions?.setVolume(+e.target. value / 100)}
      />
      <button onClick={actions?.screenShot}  >ScreenShot</button>
      <button onClick={actions?.download}>Download</button>
    </div>
  ),
}}

```

### Option 4: Custom Buttons

Users can add custom buttons to the control bar by providing an array of custom button objects. Each button object specifies the button's content and placement (either "left" or "right").

```jsx
controller={{
  customButtons: [
    { content: <div>Button 1</div>, placement: "left" },
    { content: <div>Button 2</div>, placement: "right" },
  ],
}}

```
